The usage instructions that were formerly in this file are obsolete and
have been (mostly) replaced by the two Distutils manuals, both included
in the Distutils source distribution:

    "Installing Python Modules"      doc/inst/inst.tex
    "Distributing Python Modules"    doc/dist/dist.tex

If you don't feel like wrestling LaTeX and the Python documentation
tools into submission, you can find PDF, PostScript, and HTML versions
of these manuals at the Distutils documentation page:

    http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/doc/

Not all of the information that was formerly in this file is in those
manuals yet, but I'm working on it!  Contributions (in the form of
patches to the LaTeX source) are welcome.
