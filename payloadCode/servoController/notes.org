This directory contains the code needed to control the servo which
detaches the parachute from the rover upon landing.

The code uses the Adafruit BeagleBone I/O library.
Setup instructions are at: http://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-io-python-library-on-beaglebone-black/

The code is also based upon an Adafruit tutorial for controlling a
servo, found at here: http://learn.adafruit.com/controlling-a-servo-with-a-beaglebone-black/



* TODO For some reason, after I installed the Adafruit library, it wasn't
available the next time after I rebooted.
* TODO We need to write a script to export the correct GPIO pin, so that it's
usable through the GPRS cape.
* TODO If we encounter any exceptions in the PWM code, we need to perform a
PWM.stop() and a PWM.cleanup() if we've already started.
* TODO Document our pin configuration and the sequence of setup steps we
need to take.
* TODO Add to our pre-launch procedures to make sure the servo is wound
in the proper direction.
