* This directory contains the code needed to control the servo which
detaches the parachute from the rover upon landing.
* The code uses the Adafruit BeagleBone I/O library.
Setup instructions are at: http://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-io-python-library-on-beaglebone-black/
* The code is also based upon an Adafruit tutorial for controlling a
servo, found at here: http://learn.adafruit.com/controlling-a-servo-with-a-beaglebone-black/
* TODO If we encounter any exceptions in the PWM code, we need to perform a
PWM.stop() and a PWM.cleanup() if we've already started.
* TODO Add to our pre-launch procedures to make sure the servo is wound
in the proper direction.
* WIRING SETUP:
| Servo wire | BeagleBone pin | Pin name |
| Black      | P8_02          | DGND     |
| Red        | P9_06          | VDD_5V   |
| Yellow     | P8_13          | GPIO_23  |
* PUTTING IT TOGETHER
** 1) Boot the beagle board.
** 2) Plug in the wires.
** 3) Make sure the servo is rotated as far COUNTER-CLOCKWISE as possible.
** 4) Run any programs that use the servo.
