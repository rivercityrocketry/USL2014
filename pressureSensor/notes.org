* Note on setting up the BMP180 pressure sensor.
* Arduino setup:
** Setup guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bmp180-barometric-pressure-sensor-hookup-/
** IMPORTANT: Connect the + and - parts *ONLY* to a 3.3V power supply.
** Larger voltages will *PERMANENTLY DAMAGE THE PART*.
** Pinout:
| Arduino pin       | Board output |
| A4                | DA           |
| A5                | CL           |
| GND               | -            |
| *3.3* V *NOT* 5V! | +            |
| Leave unconnected | IO           |
* BeagleBoard setup:
** Pin diagram: http://www.alexanderhiam.com/blog/beaglebone-pinout/
AIN4 = 33
AIN5 = 36
** IMPORTANT: Connect the + and - parts *ONLY* to a 3.3V power supply.
** Larger voltages will *PERMANENTLY DAMAGE THE PART*.
** Pinout:
| *BeagleBone Black pin*              | *Board output*        |
| P9.20 [I2C1_SDA]                    | DA - SDA in i2c terms |
| P9.19 [I2C1_SCL]                    | CL - SCL in i2c terms |
| P9.1 [GND]                          | -                     |
| P9.4 [3.3 V] *BE CAREFUL-5V NEARBY* | +                     |
| Leave unconnected                   | IO                    |
