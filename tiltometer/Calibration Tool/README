Calibration Tool
================
==Purpose==
This set of tools will assist us in debugging the tiltometer, by
allowing us to read data from the Arduino into the host computer,
and then visualizing it with Unity.

==Components==
===ArduinoSerialInterface===
A .NET project that takes care of requesting data from the Arduino's
serial port and storing it in a file. Used because Mono requires workarounds
to get serial port functionality working.

===Calibration Tool===
A Unity project that contains an object whose orientation is updated
based upon input from our accelerometer/gyroscope.

===SerialInterfaceSketch===
The Arduino sketch used to transfer data to the host through the serial port.
