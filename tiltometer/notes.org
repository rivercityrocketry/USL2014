* Notes for this project:
** Accelerometer info:
*** ADC word length
**** 16 bits.
**** TODO The spec sheet says data is in two's complement. Do I need to do conversions to get it usable?
*** Sensitivity [based upon the selected range]:
**** AFS_SEL=0: 16,384 LSB/g
**** AFS_SEL=1: 8,192  LSB/g
**** AFS_SEL=2: 4,096  LSB/g
**** AFS_SEL=3: 2,048  LSB/g
*** Reference voltage:
**** 1.8V +/- 5%
**** Referred to as VLOGIC in the data sheet.
*** Zero-g outputs:
**** TODO Do I need to convert these into raw accel. readings and figure out the offsets?
**** X-axis: +/- 50 milli-g
**** Y-axis: +/- 50 milli-g
**** Z-axis: +/- 80 milli-g
** Gyro info
*** Full-scale range:
**** FS_SEL=0: +/- 250  deg./s.
**** FS_SEL=1: +/- 500  deg./s.
**** FS_SEL=2: +/- 1000 deg./s.
**** FS_SEL=3: +/- 2000 deg./s.
*** Sensitivity scale factor [based upon the selected range]:
**** FS_SEL=0: 131  LSB/(deg./s.)
**** FS_SEL=1: 65.5 LSB/(deg./s.)
**** FS_SEL=2: 32.8 LSB/(deg./s.)
**** FS_SEL=3: 16.4 LSB/(deg./s.)
**** 2^16
*** ADC word length
**** 16 bits
*** Reference voltage:
**** 1.8V +/- 5%. Marked as VLOGIC in data sheet.
*** Zero output:
**** +/- 20 deg./s.
**** TODO The IMU guide mentions that we should measure the 0g values ourselves rather than trusting the specs.
** Pin connections
*** I'm using the pin connection setup mentioned by some guy on the SparkFun product page at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11028
*** Connections:
**** MPU6050 connections:
***** VDD   - Arduino 3.3v
***** GND   - Arduino GND
***** INT   - Arduino digital pin 2
***** FSYNC - leave unconnected
***** SCL   - Arduino SCL (dedicated pin or Analog 5)
***** SDA   - Arduino SDA (dedicated pin or Analog 4)
***** VIO   - Arduino 3.3v
***** CLK   - leave unconnected
***** ASCL  - leave unconnected
***** ASDA  - leave unconnected
**** Seeed SD shield connections:
| Arduino pin | Seeed pin |
| 5V          | 5V        |
| GND         | GND       |
| D11         | D11       |
| D10         | D10       |
| D12         | D12       |
| D13         | D13       |
**** If you want an LED to light when the launch angle is not safe: Arduino digital 12 = LED pin.
**** The push-button should be setup according to the steps at: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-use-a-push-button-switch-with-arduino/
* TODO List
** Items to complete: [0/9]
*** TODO I need to properly calculate my gyro and accelerometer sensitivity and similar values. That could be causing the weird Z angles I've been seeing.
*** TODO Get the logic for subtracting out the most outlying last few readings working.
*** TODO Figure out which angle is pointing up relative to the rocket.
*** TODO Hook up an LED. When angle between the axis > 20 degrees, light LED. Else, don't light it.
**** TODO Set up an experiment where we put the tiltometer on a flat surface. Get a protractor, and measure its angle when the LED lights. Take photos to include in FRR.
*** TODO Complete all the TODO items listed in the source code.
*** TODO Add a post-launchpad entry to the checklist to determine the time of launch based on a standard time, using the device that recorded the time.
*** TODO Add an entry/page to the wiki for all items to be completed prior to FRR.
*** TODO Do more extensive drift testing. Leave it on overnight with a delay() in the loop, etc. Counteract any drift we see.
*** TODO WAITING Log the current time, current orientation estimate, and whether or not it's safe to launch.
**** WAITING: Waiting for the SD card breakout board that Carlos ordered to come
     in. The code is almost all in place in the FinalSketch file.
     Search for: "Data to log
*** TODO Get the calibration setup from the reset button working.
** Done items [3/3]
*** DONE Preliminary drift test.
*** DONE Get the angle detection working.
*** DONE We'll need to find a way of logging when we received the signal to launch.
 We can probably log acceleration as well as we ascend, and check for a  gigantic spike.
**** SOLUTION Justin's side can record when the Raven fired, so we can correlate that with our note of launch time.
